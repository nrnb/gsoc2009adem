/**
 * A bare-minimum definition of a graph.  A given edge in a graph can
 * be either <i>directed</i> or <i>undirected</i>.  Directedness of edges
 * is an important part of graph topology for calculations such as
 * finding a path <i>from</i> node A <i>to</i> node B.  A number of edges
 * between two nodes may exist; this number may have significance in some
 * applications, and so we don't want to represent an undirected edge
 * simply as two directed edges which are exact opposites of each other.<p>
 * Some extreme cases of graphs representable with this object are
 * graphs containing only nodes and no edges.  Another strange graph is one
 * with just one node and a million edges.  An erroneous graph is one
 * with one edge and no nodes, because the presence of one edge implies that
 * at least one node exists (an edge may in fact start and end at the same
 * node).<p>
 * Topologists claim that they can't tell a donut apart from a coffee cup.
 * In fact, a coffee cup with a handle can be &quot;smoothly morphed&quot;
 * into a donut shape.  In topology, distances do not matter but connectedness
 * does.  Therefore, a topological definition of a graph should not
 * contain any notion of a &quot;distance along edge&quot;.<p>
 * <!--
 * If the graph definition defined in this object were translated into
 * a language suitable for an elementary mathematics textbook on set theory,
 * it would read something like this (our version of set theory treats
 * {a,a} and {a} as not equal - that is, repeated elements in a set
 * are honored):
 * <blockquote>A <i>graph</i> is an ordered set of exactly 3 elements:
 * <ol><li>a set N of pairwise unique elements</li>
 *     <li>a set of ordered pairs of elements in N, where an
 *         <i>ordereed pair</i> is an ordered set of 2 elements</li>
 *     <li>a set of pairs of elements in N, where a <i>pair</i>
 *         is a set of 2 elements</li></ol>
 * To help our intuition, we can nickname N &quot;the set of nodes&quot;,
 * we can nickname the second set &quot;the set of directed edges&quot;,
 * and we can nickname the third set &quot;the set of undirected
 * edges&quot;.</blockquote>
 * An example set G defining a graph would be:
 * <blockquote><nobr>&lt; {a,b,c}, {&lt;a,b&gt;,&lt;b,c&gt;,&lt;c,a&gt;}, {} &gt;</nobr></blockquote>
 * Another example:
 * <blockquote><nobr>&lt; {d,e}, {&lt;d,e&gt;}, {{d,d},{d,e},{d.e},{e,d}} &gt;</nobr></blockquote>
 * Notice that
 * in the second example above, {d,e} is equal to {e,d}; this graph
 * has 3 &quot;undirected edges&quot; &quot;between nodes&quot; d and e.<p>
 * -->
 * The methods on this interface do not expose any mutable behavior; this does
 * not mean, however, that instances of this interface are not mutable.  A
 * sub-interface extending <code>GraphTopology</code> could be defined which
 * exposes mutable functionality.

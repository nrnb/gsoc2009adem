  /**
   * Returns a neighboring nodes list.<p>
   * Let's define a binary relation on nodes in a graph, called
   * <i>neighbor</i>: Node A is a <i>neighbor</i> of node
   * B if and only if there exists an edge E such that A and B are
   * endpoints of E.<p>
   * What I mean by A and B being <i>endpoints</i>
   * of an edge E: Node A is an <i>endpoint</i> of edge E if and only if
   * at least one of the following is true:
   * <ol><li>E is directed and A is the source node of E.</li>
   *     <li>E is directed and B is the target node of E.</li>
   *     <li>E is undirected and A is &quot;node 0&quot; of E.</li>
   *     <li>E is undirected and B is &quot;node 1&quot; of E.</li></ol><p>
   * It can be proven that the <i>neighbors</i> relation on the set of nodes
   * in a graph is <i>symmetric</i>; that is, if A is a neighbor of B then
   * B is a neighbor of A.<p>
   * If node N is the node at index <code>nodeIndex</code> then this method
   * returns indices of all nodes Q such that Q is a neighbor of
   * node N.<p>
   * Let's now look at some examples so that we get a feeling for how
   * this method behaves (referring back to the definition).
   * <ul><li>A graph has exactly 2 [unique] nodes G and H and exactly one edge
   *         W which is undirected; G is &quot;node 0&quot; of W and H is
   *         &quot;node 1&quot; of W.  if we ask
   *         to get neighbors of G with this method, it should (and will)
   *         return a list of length 1, containing only node H.  Let's
   *         prove why G is not returned as a neighboring node of G.
   *         Assume G is a neighbor of G.  By definition, it follows that
   *         there exists an edge E such that E has endpoint nodes G and G.
   *         There exists only a single edge, and so W must have endpoint nodes
   *         G and G.  Contradiction.
   *         Therefore our assumption is false - that
   *         is, G is <i>not</i> a neighbor of G.  Therefore G
   *         will not be returned in the list of neighboring nodes of G.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param nodeIndex the index of the node whose neighbors we're trying
   *   to find.
   * @return a non-repeating list of indices of all nodes B such that
   *   <i>B is a neighbor of node at index
   *   <code>nodeIndex</code></i>; every entry in the returned iterator will
   *   lie in the interval
   *   <nobr><code>[0, graph.getNumNodex() - 1]</code></nobr>; this method
   *   never returns <code>null</code>.
   * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if <code>nodeIndex</code> is not
   *   in the interval <nobr><code>[0, graph.getNumNodes() - 1]</code></nobr>.
